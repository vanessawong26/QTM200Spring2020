# ANSWER: 90% confidence interval is (94.1, 102.7)
# INTERPRETATION: We are 90% confident that that true average IQ of students at her school lies between 94.1 and 102.7.

# n=25 therefore df = 24

1-pt(abs(-0.596), df=24)
# p-value = 0.278
# ANSWER/INTERPRETATION: p-value = 0.278 > 0.05 therefore sample mean is not significantly greater than 100
