## Data on 1932 German Election (at precinct level)
## Paper: G. King, O. Rosen, M. Tanner, A.F. Wagner (2008)
## “Ordinary economic voting behavior in the extraordinary
## election of Adolf Hitler.”
load("nazis.Rdata")
## DV for today -- nazi share of the vote in each precinct
nazis$nazishare <- nazis$nazivote / nazis$nvoter
hist(nazis$nazishare)
## lm() function is for regression aka "linear model"
?lm
## Bivariate regression where outcome variable is share of
## vote for Nazis and explanatory variable is proportion of
## self-employed voters
## Theory:  those who were hurt by the economy but were at little risk of
## unemployment -- such as self-employed shopkeepers and professionals,
## were the groups that gave the most disproportionate support to the Nazis
mod_self <- lm(nazishare ~ shareself, data = nazis)
## summary() function displays detailed model output
## Do you see beta, standard error, tvalue, and pvalue?
summary(mod_self)
## Note that beta/std error = tvalue
## Why? What were the null and alternative hypotheses?
.455/.08175
## Confidence interval for our slope estimate
tval <- qt(1-(.05/2), df = 681-2, lower.tail = TRUE) ## high n, so approx 1.96
.455 - (tval*0.08175)
.455 + (tval*0.08175)
## Let's plot our line against the data
plot(x = nazis$shareself, y = nazis$nazishare, pch = "+",
cex = .75, xlab = "Share Self-Employed", ylab = "Nazi Share of Vote",
main = "1932 German Election Results,\nby Precinct")
