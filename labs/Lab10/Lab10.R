# Some studies show that politically irrelevant events, such as 
# sports events and shark attacks, affect voters' retrospective
# evaluation of government performance. For example, Busby et al.
# (2017) find that the outcome of a college football game affects
# presidental job approval among students.

load("Busby_Football.RData")
colnames(x)

# Experimental setting: Busby et al. (2017) randomly assigned students 
# from Ohio State University (OSU) and University of Oregon (UO) to 
# answer a survey before and after the 2015 College Football Playoff 
# National Championship game. OSU won the game 42-20, and thus, OSU is 
# the "winning school" and UO is the "losing school." They find that among 
# OSU students, presidential approval was higher for those who answered 
# the survey after the game than those who answered the survey before the 
# game. By contast, among UO students, presidential approval was lower for
# those who answered the survey after the game than those who answered the 
# survey before the game. t-tests below confirm their findings.

# papprove: presidential approval
# Post: 0 = pre-game survey vs 1 = post-game survey
# osu: 0 = UO (losing) vs 1 = OSU (winning)

# Comparison of OSU students before and after the game
t.test(papprove ~ Post, data=x[x$osu==1,])

# Comparison of UO students before and after the game
t.test(papprove ~ Post, data=x[x$osu==0,])

# 2. Run a linear model with papprove as a dependent variable and 
#    Post, osu, and the interaction of the two as independent variables.




# 3. Answer the following questions based on the results.

# 3a. What is the predicted presidential approval of OSU students who received
#     the survey BEFORE the game?


# 3b. What is the predicted presidential approval of OSU students who received
#     the survey AFTER the game?


# 3c. What is the predicted presidential approval of UO students who received
#     the survey BEFORE the game?


# 3d. What is the predicted presidential approval of UO students who received
#     the survey AFTER the game?


# 3e. What is the marginal effect of Post on presidential approval
#     when osu=1?




################ Additional Question ################ 

# 4. The dataset includes a lot of variables about student characteristics,
#    like age and gender. Add some of these variables to the model above and
#    re-run a regression. Does the inclusion of these controls attenuate their
#    findings? Why or why not?
