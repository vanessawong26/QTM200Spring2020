\section*{Question 1 (50 points): Political Science}	
\noindent Consider the data set \texttt{MexicoMuniData.csv}, which includes municipal-level information from Mexico. The outcome of interest is the number of times the winning PAN presidential candidate in 2006 (\texttt{PAN.visits.06}) visited a district leading up to the 2009 federal elections, which is a count. Our main predictor of interest is whether the district was highly contested, or whether it was not (the PAN or their opponents have electoral security) in the previous federal elections during 2000 (\texttt{competitive.district}), which is binary (1=close/swing district, 0="safe seat"). We also include \texttt{marginality.06} (a measure of poverty) and \texttt{PAN.governor.06} (a dummy for whether the state has a PAN-affiliated governor) as additional control variables. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)]
	Run a Poisson regression because the outcome is a count variable. Is there evidence that PAN presidential candidates visit swing districts more? Provide a test statistic and p-value.
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=44, lastline=45]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] p = 0.161, z = -1.402
	\item[-] p \textgreater 0.05, therefore swing district status is not a statiscally reliable predictor of the number of visits the winning PAN candidate made in 2006. thus there is no evidence that PAN presidential candidates' visits swing districts more.
	\item [(b)]
	Interpret the \texttt{marginality.06} and \texttt{PAN.governor.06} coefficients.
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=54, lastline=54]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] marginality coef. (exp) = 0.1226841
	\item[-] marginality coef (non-exp) = -2.0981
	\item[-] interpetation: holding all other variables constant, a one unit increase in poverty is associated with an average decrease in district visits by a multiplicative factor of 0.1227.
	\item[-] PAN.governor coef. (exp) = 0.8127638
	\item[-] PAN.governor coef (non-exp) = -0.2073
	\item[-] interpretation: holding all other variables constant, a district's having a PAN-affiliated governor is associated with an average decrease in district visits by a multiplicative factor of 0.8128.
	
	\item [(c)]
	Provide the estimated mean number of visits from the winning PAN presidential candidate for a hypothetical district that was competitive (\texttt{competitive.district}=1), had an average poverty level (\texttt{marginality.06} = 0), and a PAN governor (\texttt{PAN.governor.06}=1).
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=67, lastline=68]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] the estimated mean number of visits from winning PAN presidential candidates under these conditions is 0.01008 (approximately 0 visits).
	
\end{enumerate}
	

\section*{Question 2 (50 points): Biology}
\noindent We'll be using data from a longitudinal sleep study of under 20 undergraduate students ($n$=18), which took place over the course of 10 days to see if sleep deprivation has any effect on participants' reaction time. Load the data through the \texttt{lmer} package.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	Create a "pooled" linear model where you regress \texttt{Days} on the outcome \texttt{Reaction}. Make sure to run regression diagnostics to check if the variance around the regression line is equal for every year.
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=77, lastline=78]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] model: y = 251.405 + 10.467x
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=80, lastline=80]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] based on residuals vs. fitted values plot, residuals (variance) appears to be constant based on normal Q-Q plot, normality assumption appears to be met as all points are clustered very tightly around the QQ line.
	
	
	\item Fit an "un-pooled" regression model with varying intercepts for patient (include an additive factor for patient) and save the fitted values.
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=86, lastline=87]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] fitted values:
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=88, lastline=110]{PS7_answers2.R}
	
	\item Fit a "un-pooled" regression model with varying slopes of time (days) for patients (include only the interaction \texttt{Days:Subject}) and save the fitted values.
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=114, lastline=115]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] fitted values:
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=116, lastline=136]{PS7_answers2.R}
	
	\item Fit an "un-pooled" regression model with varying intercepts for patients with varying slopes of time (days) by patient (include the interaction and constituent terms of \texttt{Days} and \texttt{Subject}, \texttt{Days + Subject + Days:Subject}) and save the fitted values.
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=139, lastline=140]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] fitted values:
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=141, lastline=178]{PS7_answers2.R}
	
	\item Fit a "semi-pooled" multi-level model with varying-intercept for subject and varying-slope of day by subject. Is it worthwhile for us to run a multi-level model with varying effects of time by subject? Why? Compare your model from part 5 to the other completely "pooled" or "un-pooled models".
	\lstinputlisting[firstline=180, lastline=188]{PS7_answers2.R}
	\item[-] No, because the semipooled multilevel model appears to be pretty similar to the pooled and unpooled models, especially the unpooled model.
