# Some studies show that politically irrelevant events, such as 
# sports events and shark attacks, affect voters' retrospective
# evaluation of government performance. For example, Busby et al.
# (2017) find that the outcome of a college football game affects
# presidental job approval among students.

load("Busby_Football.RData")
colnames(x)

# 1. Run a linear model with papprove as a dependent variable and 
#    Post, osu, and the interaction of the two as independent variables.

lm(papprove ~ Post+osu + Post:osu, data=x)


# 2. Answer the following questions based on the results.

# 2a. What is the predicted presidential approval of OSU students who received
#     the survey BEFORE the game?

# after = 1
# before = 0
# osu = 1
# non-osu = 0

# equation: papprove = 4.5619 - 0.3780x
# x = 1 bc OSU students 


# 2b. What is the predicted presidential approval of OSU students who received
#     the survey AFTER the game?


# 2c. What is the predicted presidential approval of UO students who received
#     the survey BEFORE the game?


# 2d. What is the predicted presidential approval of UO students who received
#     the survey AFTER the game?


# 3e. What is the marginal effect of Post on presidential approval
#     when osu=1?
